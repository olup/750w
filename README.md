# 750 WORDS REACT

Check it out here : [750W LIVE](https://750w.surge.sh)

**Now with save to dropbox feature**

Keep your writer shape by choosing the 750 workout - write regular session where the only thing that matters is to get to 750 words. You choose if you want to be able to edit, but we recomend you keep the edit mode off.

Only once you get to the target are you able to download your words, with a title and some tags.

We also added some styles option, a typewriter scroll effect and a spellchacker disable button (those little red lines are sooo anoying)

Great for speed writing, journaling, draft or just to type away.
